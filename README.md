# Tract ID Smart Contract

The Tract ID Smart Contract is a blockchain-based solution that can be used to manage land ownership and rights on tribal lands. This smart contract can be used to create a secure and immutable registry of land ownership and rights, which can help prevent encroachment and support land claims. The Tract ID Smart Contract is particularly relevant for Native American tribes, as traditional land management practices often involved communal ownership and use of land.

## How it works

The Tract ID Smart Contract is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses Solidity programming language. The smart contract stores information about the Tract ID, which is a unique identifier for each piece of land on a reservation or tribal land. The Tract ID is composed of several elements, including the Land Area Code (LAC), which identifies the state and county where the land is located, and the SFX, which identifies the type of land (e.g., trust land, fee land, or restricted land). Other elements include the Principal Meridian and Base Line (PLANT), Section, Township, and Range, which are used to identify the specific location of the land within a particular area.

The Tract ID Smart Contract includes a range of features to help manage land ownership and rights on tribal lands. These features include:

- **Ownership transfer**: The Tract ID Smart Contract includes a function that allows the current owner of the Tract ID to transfer ownership to a new owner. This ensures that land ownership and rights can be transferred securely and efficiently.

- **Immutable record-keeping**: The Tract ID Smart Contract is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that all records are secure and immutable. This ensures that the ownership and rights of tribal lands are recorded accurately and cannot be altered or tampered with.

- **Secure ownership tracking**: The Tract ID Smart Contract includes a variable that stores the address of the current owner of the Tract ID. This ensures that ownership can be tracked securely and accurately over time.
